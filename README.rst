Mozilla's Crowdsourced In-Page Pop-Up URLs
==========================================

For a period of about 11 months—March 2018 to January 2019—Mozilla asked
volunteers to report URLs that showed in-page pop-ups. Using a `custom add-on
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/in-page-pop-up-reporter/>`_,
Firefox users contributed over 12,000 of these, which we now make available to
you. Thanks to all who participated! Watch this space for applications of
this research.

Thanks
